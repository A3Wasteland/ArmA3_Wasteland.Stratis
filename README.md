# A3Wasteland Stratis

A3Wasteland is a survival-like combat sandbox, which incorporates elements of team deathmatch and sector control in one big fun-to-play package. Similar to DayZ, the objectives are to scavenge weapons and vehicles, team up with fellow players, and engage in combat to obtain control of the landscape. Best experienced with 50 or more players. 

The source code is based on [GoT Wasteland](https://github.com/JoSchaap/GoT_Wasteland_V2.Stratis), which is based on [404 Wasteland](https://github.com/domuk/Arma3-404Wasteland-Stratis), which is based on [Sa-Matra's Wasteland](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?142427), which is finally based on [Tonic's Wasteland](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?140070).

The mission has come a long way since 404 Wasteland. A large portion of the code a has been rewritten, and it contains many new features like territory capture, player saving, vehicle saving, vehicle stores, new secondary missions, and more.
