"Hints and Tips",
"
<br/><font size='18'>A3Wasteland</font>
<br/>
<br/>* At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.
<br/>
<br/>* When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, map-bound bases, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.
<br/>
<br/>* If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.
<br/>
<br/>* Always be on the lookout for nightvision. they are located in the ammo crates, and there are pairs scattered throughout vehicles. You can also purchase them from the gunstores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.
<br/>
<br/>* When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.
<br/>
<br/>* There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.

"About Wasteland",
"
<br/>Wasteland is a team versus team versus team sandbox survival experience. The objective of this mission is to rally your faction, scavenge supplies, weapons, and vehicles, and destroy the other factions. It is survival at its best! Keep in mind this is a work in progress, please direct your reports to http://forums.a3wasteland.com/
<br/>
<br/>FAQ:
<br/>
<br/>Q. What am I supposed to do here?
<br/>A. See the above description
<br/>
<br/>Q. Where can I get a gun?
<br/>A. Weapons are found in one of three places, first in ammo crates that come as rewards from missions, , and second, in the gear section of the vehicles, which also randomly spawn around the map. The last place to find a gun would be at the gunshops located throughout the map. You can also find them on dead players whose bodies have not yet been looted.
<br/>
<br/>Q. What are the blue circles on the map?
<br/>A. The circles represent town limits. If friendly soldiers are in a town, you can spawn there from the re-spawn menu; however if there is an enemy presence, you will not be able to spawn there.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Why is it so dark, I cant see.
<br/>A. The server has a day/night cycle just like in the real world, and as such, night time is a factor in your survival. It is recommended that you find sources of light or use your Nightvision Goggles as the darkness sets in.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Is it ok for me to shoot my team mates?
<br/>A. If you are member of BLUFOR or OPFOR teams, then you are NOT allowed to shoot or steal items and vehicles from other players. If you play as Independent, you are free to engage anyone as well as team up with anyone you want.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Whats with the canisters, baskets and big bags?
<br/>A. This game has a food and water system that you must stay on top of if you hope to survive. You can collect food and water from food sacks and wells, or baskets and plastic canisters dropped by dead players. Food and water will also randomly spawn around the map.
<br/>
<br/>Q. I saw someone breaking a rule, what do I do?
<br/>A. Simply go into global chat and get the attention of one of the admins or visit our forums, and make a report if the offense is serious.

<br/> * No Channel Spamming, do not join different channels in a short period of time. A lot of people run dual monitors and spamming channels will catch their eye. Causing issues with gameplay. This is also annoying for people in the channels.
<br/> * DO NOT Spam message anyone or any channel.
<br/> * If you use voice activation or continuous transmission and you have a lot of background noise you will be asked to fix it. If it is not fixed YOU WILL be put on forced PTT (push to talk). Admins will apply or remove this at their own discretion.
<br/> * No music transmission, unless used in conversation. We use Discord to communicate, *not listen to your music.
<br/> * New Discord users will be granted (Approved Guest) once the rules have been explained to you and verification that you understand the rules.
<br/> * Use of the @Everyone command is restricted to FRAC Staff for official announcements only. The @Here may be used in channels sparingly for important topics only. Misuse or spamming of these commands will result in a ban.
<br/> * Basic etiquette should be used when joining channels including:
<br/> * - Listening to the channel first to not cut off people 
<br/> * - Refraining from loud introductory noise (i.e. don't join a room yelling (GOOODDDDD MORRNINGGGG!!!!!)
<br/> * - Giving priority of in-game communications in respective game channels over (chit chat). 
<br/> * - Any channel with a player limit lock is specifically designated for gameplay and anyone joining these channels should take care not to speak over players in game or cause distractions.

<br/> * You are allowed to talk in Side VON (Voice Over Network or Voice),  DO NOT Spam side chat in VON. If people say to stop, most likely you are over using side chat and will be considered as spam.
<br/> * Only English may be used in Global, Side and Direct VON and/or Chats. Other languages may be used in Group VON/chats.
<br/> * DO NOT advertise or type another community, Clan, or Personal Teamspeak/Discord information in global/side chat. If you are grouped up with another player, you are allowed to type it in group.
<br/> * If a player is invisible tell him to relog on the server, If he does not we will kill then kick him from the server. (This is a glitch on the server that occasionally happens)
<br/> * If you are in 1st person mode and you attempt to go into 3rd person mode (Num Pad Enter : Default) and cannot go into 3rd person or do not see your character, log off and reconnect. If this does not fix it ask an admin to slay you, or commit suicide.
<br/> * Camping stores is allowed. Wasteland is a HARSH survival map. Learn to deal with it and go on your way.
<br/> * We will not refund any money for any reason UNLESS you have video evidence that a fluke on our server caused you to lose something of value. (flukes) are NOT to include Server Restarts or Server Wipes.
<br/> * Remember, combat is not a regulated sport. If you die because you think it was unfair (aside from cheating, hacking, or exploiting). Re-spawn and try again.
<br/> * Ammo resupply vehicles are used for resupply, NOT for spamming. If you are caught spamming while using an ammo vehicle, this is considered an exploit, you will be banned from the server.
<br/> * No combat logging. If you are caught doing this you will face punishment. If you log off and come back in a brief amount of time to gain an advantage we will punish you. You may not log off while a (Sugar Daddy/HVT) after completing a (Hackers) mission type, doing so will result in punishment.
<br/> * Ghosting is forbidden. This means changing teams with players in the area with the intent to come back and kill them. This also applies to Independent groups kicking and killing other players.
